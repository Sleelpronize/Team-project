# Sleepronize
Space Apps Challenge - Sleep Shift Scheduling Tool
# Summary
Sleepronize is an expedient application designed to help Astronauts, shift workers, and international travelers manage fatigue during their work hours. Sleepronize takes as input basic information such as launch date/ time and work shift time to calculate and craft a custom-made sleep, meal, and exercise schedule. Sleepronize has its core purpose in maintaining circadian synchronization and does so by guiding the user to follow a specifically designed schedule two days before launching a new sleep cycle. Beyond computing suitable schedules, SleepCustomized also lists dietary suggestions according to the user’s sleep shift schedule to help achieve maximum productivity.

It is estimated that 50 to 70 million Americans chronically suffer from a disorder of sleep and wakefulness, hindering daily functioning and adversely affecting health and        longevity. We have come with an efficient, accurate and powerful scheduling system for sleep, meal and exercise to be used by society. Our app is essential to astronauts, shift workers and international travelers because it encompasses three major aspects: sleep, meal, and exercise, tailoring each aspect according to the astronaut’s needs. Furthermore, it allows one to input their normal sleep schedule in order to design a schedule that deviates the least. The working principle is that individuals fill out each section according to their schedule; following that our app calculates the optimal time for the three aspects and recommends it to them in addition to that the app also recommends the type of meals to eat based on the time of day. The input includes launch date, launch time, launch duration, flight duration, shift scheduled start, and end time. We hope that this app can be of use to the public and NASA to maximize productivity and efficiency.
# How We Developed This Project
# What inspired us
We were looking at every challenge to find the one we could make a difference on. When we first came across the challenge, we did not fully comprehend the problem but when we dug further, we found it to be the right fit for us. We could really relate to how sleep misalignment affects productivity in being in such a demanding school, so we wanted to help out to the best of our capabilities. We used the resources given by NASA space app, additional information from “The Verge” and other websites as tools in our project.

# Tools
Programming language:c#
Application: android sdk
Unity
Mono develop
Visual studio
#
We did not make use of hardware equipment other than our laptops but we have plans to incorporate small speakers that can be attached near the auditory nerves to send out frequency signals. This equipment will help astronauts follow their schedule diligently. The most prominent problem we faced was that, it was hard to design an algorithm that was flexible for the schedules but in the end, we were able to conquer it. 

# Our achievements include:
1. Devise an efficient sleeping schedule

2. Design a sleep schedule that least deviates from the original 

3. Incorporate sleep, meal and exercise schedules all together

4. Design a user friendlily interface

5. Make use of simple techniques that are easy to understand.
# How We Used Space Agency Data in This Project
LIGHTING CONDITIONS

The space station orbits Earth every 90 minutes, which means the crew members see 16 sunrises each day. This frequent change from darkness to light severely impacts the body’s ability to adjust to a natural circadian rhythm. To combat this, lighting on the station is being transitioned from General Luminaire Assemblies (GLAs) to Solid-State Light Assemblies (SSLAs). SSLAs allow the crew members to adjust the color spectrum and intensity of the light to promote alertness and circadian resetting, or to promote sleep. Many laboratory investigations have shown that bright lights, when administered appropriately, provide a safe, reversible, non-pharmacological countermeasure to evoke alertness and enhance performance. Minimizing light from digital devices in the evening can help prevent circadian misalignment.

Sleepronize figures out whether the user’s bedtime is delayed or advanced and gives lighting suggestions accordingly. If the new bedtime is a few hours in advance of the typical bedtime, lighting conditions are suggested to dim to simulate a nighttime environment. If the new bedtime of the user is a few hours delayed, day time lighting conditions are suggested to stimulate a day environment. This in turn maintains the circadian entrainment of the mind. 

#PRESCRIBED PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION
Once a crew member has exhausted the aforementioned options for successful circadian shifting techniques, options for pharmacological interventions are explored. Crew members may use three classes of medication to aid in sleep: chronobiologic, hypnotic, and alertness. Before spaceflight, flight surgeons conduct ground testing on each crew member to test individual physiological responses while using a variety of sleep-aid and alertness medication to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the crew.
Melatonin supplements were not developed to treat insomnia, rather to help reschedule circadian rhythms when timed correctly. Taking over the counter and prescription melatonin supplements can help you wake up and go to bed at different times of the day. A standard dose of melatonin is 0.5 milligrams, and supplements should be taken a few hours before bedtime under the instruction and care of a sleep specialist.
Sleepronize figures out the new bedtime and takes two different paths. If the bedtime is delayed, sleepronize suggests administration of any prescribe alertness medication – if any. If the bedtime is a few hours in advance, however, sleep on ze takes a different path and suggests and prescribed sleep-inducing medication – if any. These in turn help the user to fall asleep at the right timing to shift the sleep cycle without causing circadian misalignment. 

# MEAL TIMING 

Circadian rhythms regulate when we feel hungry and how we digest food. Some studies have found that advancing or delaying meals8 can alter how your circadian rhythm regulates these processes, causing you to feel alert and tired at different times than those you’ve become accustomed to.
The human body runs according to a roughly 24-hour cycle, controlled by a "master" clock in the brain and peripheral clocks in other parts of the body that are synchronized according to external cues, including light. Now, researchers reporting in Current Biology on June 1 have found that at least one of those clocks can also be reset based on what time a person eats breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
After figuring out any the sleep shift amount and whether it is in advance of the typical bedtime or delayed, sleepronzie adjusts all meals timing accordingly. If the user’s new bedtime is delayed, sleepronize alters all meal times to be delayed, in turn causing a delay of the circadian rhythm. If the new bedtime of the user is a few hours in advance, however, sleepronize adjusts all meal timings of the day to be a few hours in advance too. This helps to reset the circadian rhythm at a different time and allows the user to alter his/her sleep cycle without causing circadian misalignment. 

#DIETRY CHOICES

Being aware of what factors impact sleep quality and quantity is important for promoting healthy sleep hygiene, or the behaviors, environmental conditions, and other sleep-related factors that can affect sleep. Thoughtful dietary choices can lead to a better night’s sleep and help to prevent circadian misalignment.
Fruits and vegetables, Non-caffeinated beverages, Lean proteins including meat, whole grains, complex carbohydrates, nuts, water, vitamin, and supplements are some of the food components that can help fight fatigue and thus play a useful role as countermeasures to adjust the user’s circadian rhythm
Researchers, including nutritionists and sleep experts, have conducted different types of studies to try to discover the best foods for sleep. While this research provides important clues, it’s not conclusive. Some varieties of red grapes have high levels of melatonin while others have virtually none. Food such as Kiwi, Tart cherry, malted milk/night time milk, fatty fish, nuts and rice are some of the food components that can temporarily induce sleepiness. This can be a tool for adjusting the user’s sleep schedule according to his flight/launch schedule.
Sleepronize adjusts all daily meals to fit the new sleep cycle. If the new bedtime of the user is to be delayed, sleepronize suggests high energy food to help the user fight fatigue. If the new bedtime Is a few hours in advance, then sleepronize uses meals as a countermeasure to induce sleep, thus helping the user to shift his/her sleep cycle without causing circadian misalignment.

# EXERCISE



Properly-timed exercise can be used to maintain circadian synchronization.

Physical activity is the most effective way to counteract the adverse effects of weightlessness on the human body. Exercise is therefore a crucial part of the daily routine onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Over the course of a long-duration mission, astronauts must exercise approximately two hours per day. Astronauts on the station work out six out of seven days a week for 2.5 hours each day.

Sleepronize takes as input the profile information such as the regular bedtime, and the schedule of the user to figure out appropriate timing and duration of the exercise. Sleepronize uses exercise as an effective countermeasure to help shift the circadian rhythm of the body when changing sleep cycles.
